                    <p class="cmn_sec_para">The Cullen family has been in the Margaret River area for almost a century. This quirkily shaped parcel of land, situated less than 2km from the Indian Ocean, has been passed down through generations. Until the early 2000s, the land lay dormant. That changed when Digby Cullen, along with family and friends, planted a grove of 1,800 olive trees. Over the past two decades, these trees have flourished, naturally ripening and fruiting to perfection. Committed to sustainability, we've opted for organic farming methods and kept the grove un-irrigated. This approach not only enhances the flavour of our olives but also yields a healthier product. It's our way of preserving this precious land for future generations.</p>

                    <p class="cmn_sec_para">Two decades on, our olive trees stand tall in perfect rows, their branches laden with fruit, reminiscent of the Garden of Eden. We've partnered with local champions Olio Bello to press our harvest, which has graced our family's table and served as cherished gifts for years. Now, we're thrilled to share this hand grown, handcrafted olive oil with you. It's ready to be dipped in, smothered on or drizzled all over. It's absolutely sensational - but don't just take our word for it. Experience the flavour for yourself and click the 'Shop' button to bring a bottle home to your door.</p>
