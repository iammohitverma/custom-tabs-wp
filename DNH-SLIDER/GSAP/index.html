                    When we began Donovan & Ho in 2014, our vision was to be a
                    law firm in Malaysia best known for its vibrancy,
                    innovation and excellent service standards. We also had a
                    mission to educate the public on legal issues and to make
                    legal knowledge accessible.

                    the deep-seated conservatism and traditionalism of the
                    legal industry, while trying to establish a reputation in
